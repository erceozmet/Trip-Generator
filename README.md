This is the codebase for cross-platform mobile application Trip Roulette. The app has an intuitive interface that lets user personalize their trip preferences and 
allows them to create personalized daytrips on the fly! User specifies a time and a transportation method and our algorithm finds a suitable daytrip that can be completed
within the timeframe. It is a fun way of discovering new places around your vicinity.

Application is built on python's kivy library and google's locations api. The algorithm personalizes the trip based on the user's preferences of food, location and free time.
